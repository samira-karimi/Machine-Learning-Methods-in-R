# Machine-Learning-Methods-in-R

In this repository, a set of healthcare data is used and analyzed with a number of different Machine Learning methods. A certain health factor is tested against more than 200 gene mutations. The response variable is continuous and there are 208 binary attributes. The following methods were used and compared for analyzing the data:

•	Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net regression<br/>
•	Neural Network <br/>
•	Tree <br/>
•	Random Forest <br/>
•	Bayesian lasso <br/>
•	Bayesian ridge <br/>
•	horseshoe <br/>

The complete code, including cross validation and plotting is made available in this repository. Some example results are provided as well.
